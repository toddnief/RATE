Sure, she can cry and scream, but Prozac Nation sees Ricci totally out of her depth. Perhaps I'm being too harsh, but okay, I'm shifting the blame to the director. Jessica Lange is outrageous and almost reaches Faye Dunaway heights of megadramatisation. Unfortunately, I think Lange peaked with Frances, and it was all downhill from there. There was every chance of this film being slick and witty while tackling depression head-on. What we get instead is poorly acted hysteria dressed up with a stereotypical try-hard eighties veneer. I really had no sense of the film\u2019s eighties backdrop, as I was unsatisfied with the lame attempt at making believe it was the eighties just because Ms. Ricci wears a Madonna-inspired dress to her \"lost my virginity\" celebration. Come on, everyone, you are ALL better than this. The filmmakers should hang their heads in shame, and as a result of disappointment, Elizabeth Wurtzel could probably make a bundle if she sued for \"irreparable emotional damages\" due to the finished product. Go on, Lizzie, sue! I would, because this film not only fails to capture the essence of the book it was based on but also falls flat in delivering any substantial emotional depth or connection. The performances, which had the potential to elevate the material, instead succumb to over-the-top dramatics that feel forced and unconvincing. The direction lacks the subtlety and finesse needed to handle such a complex subject matter. Instead, the film resorts to clich\u00e9s and superficial portrayals that undermine its intended message. The production design, which attempts to evoke the eighties, comes across as lazy and uninspired, relying on tired tropes and visual clich\u00e9s rather than creating an authentic sense of time and place.
